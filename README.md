# Cpp17

This repository is created for educational purpose. The main idea is to store C++17 standards.
Anyone can get this repository or use wherever he/she wants.

There are two folders;

1- One of them is guided based on "Nicolai M. Josuttis - C++17 The Complete Guide" book.
2- One of them is guided by Jason Turner Youtube channel "Weekly C++".
